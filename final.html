            <h2>Lost Woods Heart Piece</h2>

Enter their house and use a bomb on the cracked wall to open the western side of the house. Now exit the house from the left room and talk to the lady, one of two 15-Second Game Operators, and she will tell you to complete the race in under fifteen seconds.<br> To do this, head up and take your first left, then when you get to a fork, take another left. When you reach the sign, go down and you will use a secret jump. After the jump, talk to the male operator to earn the fourth Piece of Heart if you completed the race in 15 seconds or less.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="hp5" class="guide">

            <h2>Dark Death Mountain Cliff Heart Piece</h2>

        </div>
        <div id="hp20" class="guide">
            <h2>Stake Garden Heart Piece</h2>
            <p>To the east of the Village of Outcasts you can find the Stake Garden. While it is blocked by the dark stones, you can use the Titan's Mitt to lift them up. Afterwards, there are 22 purple stakes in the garden that need to be pounded with the Magic Hammer, the order in which is done so does not matter. Once they are all pounded, the stump below the stakes will disappear and reveal an entrance to a cave. Once you have gone into the cave, you will find a Piece of Heart.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="hp21" class="guide">
            <h2>Misery Mire Cliff Heart Piece</h2>

Warp to the Swamp of Evil through the tile and jump of the ledge, making your way north until you see a similar structure to the entrance to Misery Mire. This building is west of the dungeon.<br>Once inside, avoid the Sparks and go down the stairs, making your way to the block puzzle at the end of the room. In order to get the Piece of Heart, you need to push the block in the bottom left corner to the left and then push the one to the right of the first block to the right.

Once you have completed the puzzle, you can obtain the twenty-second Piece of Heart.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="hp23" class="guide">
            <h2>Death Mountain Island Heart Piece</h2>
            <p>From Turtle Rock in the Dark World, travel west and then south until you reach the first large rock. When you lift it, it reveals a cave entrance. Enter the cave and go north until you come to a gap between the rest of the path. Like in other places, there is an invisible bridge. While you do not need to use the Ether Medallion in order to cross the gap, it will make for an easier time getting across. Make your way across the bridge and bomb the wall.<br>Once through, you will come to a room with three cracked walls. To get the Piece of Heart, bomb the western wall and go to the next room. Finally, exit the cave by going through the door at the bottom. Use the Magic Mirror to warp to the Light World to find the Piece of Heart.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="hp24" class="guide">
            <h2>Turtle Rock Heart Piece</h2>
            <p>In Turtle Rock, there are two rooms where Link can choose which pipe to take. In the lava-filled room, take the left pipe and go through the door it takes him to. In this room, defeat the two Hokkubokku and continue through the door to the south. Travel west and you should see a door to the south that leads outside. Dodge the Laser Eyes and exit through it.<br>Once outside, you should be on a ledge. Go to the far right side of the ledge, but do not go back inside the dungeon. Instead, use the Magic Mirror to warp back to the Light World and then go inside the cave. In order to go to the next room, defeat the four green Goriyas. Once you have, proceed to the next room where you will find a treasure chest containing the final Piece of Heart.</p>
